# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn based on a dataset from a telecom company. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscription, helping businesses take proactive retention measures.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`
- **Modeling**: Supervised classification using popular ML algorithms.
- **Notebook**: `churn_prediction.ipynb` — for data analysis, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- **Script**: `main/churn_prediction.py` — standalone Python script for running predictions.
