📊 Customer Churn Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn based on a dataset from a telecom company. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscription, helping businesses take proactive retention measures.

🔍 Project Overview
Dataset: WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv

Modeling: Supervised classification using popular ML algorithms.

Notebook: churn_prediction.ipynb — for data analysis, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

Script: main/churn_prediction.py — standalone Python script for running predictions.
